Simple, Fun Alien films' fan page disguised as an image carousel--mostly featuring Ripley ;)

Tech Stack:

  - React
  - FireStore DB
  - Will have Node.JS and Golang backend versions soon (~ sometime in Feb. 2021)
  
 To run this application, treat it like the typical React application it is:
 
  - Clone it, of course
  - npm install
  - npm start
